Things to be done- 

Exploratory Data Analysis.
Understanding what type content is available in different countries.
Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
Clustering similar content by matching text-based features. 

Discussion of Netflix Movies And Tv Shows Clustering will involve various steps such as: • Loading the data into data frame • Data Description • Exploratory Data Analysis • Data Preprocessing • Topic Modeling  LSA(Latent Semantic Analysis)  LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) • K- means Clustering • Conclusion  

That's how we have accomplished our team work in Netflix Movies And Tv Shows Clustering .Throughout the project we learn many new things right from takingproblem statement to understand the technical side of a data to analysis. We deal with Netflix data. • There are about 70% movies and 30% TV shows on Netflix. • The United States has the highest number of content on Netflix by a huge margin followed by India. • LDA and LSA has sorted much more similar titles in a group of genre. • Recommendation system works perfectly well with description column. • After applying K - means optimal value of number of clusters is 5. • Silhouette score for a set of sample data points is used to measure how dense and well-separated the clusters are.
